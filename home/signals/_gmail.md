First gate, before anything else: the sender must be someone who
matters. Everyone else is dropped, however direct their question: cold
outreach, sales and partnership pitches, agencies, recruiters I have
not written to, surveys and research requests.

People who matter:
- customers: example-customer.com, another-customer.nl;
- investors and board: example-ventures.com;
- anyone I have written to: check with `in:sent to:<sender address>`
  (or `to:@<domain>` for a company domain) before dropping a sender;
- colleagues (@acme.com) when the mail needs something from me (a
  question, decision, approval or review addressed to me), not when I
  am only in CC on a thread someone else is handling.

File only threads that ask me for an explicit action an AI session can
help with: a question to answer, a draft to write, something to
research, analyse, decide on with a recommendation, or fix. Drop FYIs,
thanks, status updates, scheduling, and threads a colleague already
owns or has resolved.

Skip newsletters, receipts, calendar notifications, automated mail,
mail from my own other accounts, and threads whose last message is mine.

Search with `in:inbox -from:me after:<window start as Unix seconds>`
(Gmail takes seconds, so the search itself excludes older mail). A
thread qualifies only when a message not from me arrived inside the
window; an older thread that is still unanswered is not new. Page
through all results and read each remaining thread with get_thread.
Source URL: the thread's `viewUrl`.
