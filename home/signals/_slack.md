Only threads that ask me for an explicit action an AI session can help
with: a question to answer, a draft to write, something to research,
analyse, decide on with a recommendation, or fix. Drop chit-chat,
thanks, FYIs, status updates, scheduling and anything a teammate
already owns or has resolved in the thread. A teammate reporting a bug
or broken tool to me, or asking me for access, counts even without an
explicit question. So does a reply in a thread I started.

My Slack user id: <@YOUR_SLACK_USER_ID>. Run these searches with
slack_search_public_and_private, each with `after` and `before` set to
the window (Unix seconds), `sort: timestamp` and `include_bots: true`:
1. DMs and group DMs: `{"filters": "is:dm"}`.
2. Messages that mention me, in any channel:
   `{"query": "<@YOUR_SLACK_USER_ID>"}`. The query is the bare mention,
   with nothing around it (`from:<@…>` would find my own messages).
3. Replies in threads I started or replied to:
   `{"filters": "is:thread with:<@YOUR_SLACK_USER_ID>"}`.
4. Optional, delete if you have none: shared customer channels I am a
   member of, named `<customer>-acme`. List them with
   slack_search_channels (query `acme`, keep names ending in `-acme`),
   keep those whose slack_list_channel_members (`response_format:
   ids_only`, every page) includes my id, then search
   `{"filters": "in:<#id1> in:<#id2> …"}` with no query. In these
   channels a request counts when it is addressed to me, or to the team
   with nobody from Acme picking it up.
Page until results are older than the window. Read the whole thread for
each hit.

People in shared channels can show up as bots (user `U00`, or an app
posting for them): treat those as people. Skip real automation (alerts,
CI and status bots, channel joins) and threads where I already gave the
last answer.

One thread is one issue, however many replies it gets. Source URL: the
permalink of the thread's root message, also when the hit is a reply.
Dedupe on the root's timestamp (the `p<digits>` part of the permalink):
a reply in a thread that already has an issue is added to that issue's
description, never a second issue.
